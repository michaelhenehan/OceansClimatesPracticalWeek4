Here are the Jupyter Notebooks for our Oceans and Climates Week 4 Practical Option 2.. the one with 'base' appended 
is the one that the students will want to open and work from. 
I have added a couple of other ones that have worked through some of the exercises, that can be used as a solution for the students, 
or for the demonstrators to look before the practical.
